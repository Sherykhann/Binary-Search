Binary search is an effective method to search for a number in a sorted array

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]
x=len(arr)

target=8  # This is a target number to be searched in an array 

left=0     # Index of the first number in the sorted array
right=x-1  # Index of the last number in the sorted array

while left<=right:
    mid=(left+right)//2     #  Find the average and round to the nearest floor integer 
    if(arr[mid]==target):    # If the element of array at mid index is == target break the loop
        print(f'the number is{arr[mid]}')
        break
    elif(arr[mid]<target):   # If the element of the array at the mid index is less than target, left index will move to mid + 1
        left=mid+1
    else:                     # if the element at mid index is > target, the right index will be lowered to one element less than mid index element 
        right=mid-1
        
                            # The process will continue until the target is found
